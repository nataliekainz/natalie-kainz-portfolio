          <h2>Hello, I'm Natalie Kainz</h2>
          <h3>Journalist • Producer • Storyteller</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
          I am an Associate Producer at NBC News' <em>Top Story with Tom Llamas</em>, passionate about 
          delivering compelling journalism that explores international affairs, culture, and technology. 
          With reporting experience across Hong Kong and the United States, I bring a global perspective 
          to every story I tell.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated from Yale University with honors in Political Science and served as Multimedia Managing 
          Editor of the Yale Daily News (2021-2022). My journalism background spans CNN International Productions, 
          NBC News, The South China Morning Post, Television Broadcasts Limited, and the New Haven Independent.
        </p>

        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          I believe great journalism is about clarity, empathy, and purpose. Every story begins with curiosity 
          and deep research, and ends with a refined narrative that informs and resonates with audiences. 
          I'm committed to amplifying voices that matter and exploring the stories that shape our world.
